Name: Anees Khan
Internship: AI/ML Virtual Internship
Due Date: 26 June 2025
Tasks Completed: Task 1, Task 4, Task 6

----------------------------------------
TASK 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
----------------------------------------

Objective:
To load, inspect, and visualize the Iris dataset using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Steps Performed:
- Loaded the dataset (either via seaborn or iris.csv)
- Printed shape, column names, and first 5 rows
- Used .info() and .describe() for summary statistics
- Created:
  - Scatter plot matrix (pairplot) to show feature relationships
  - Histograms for value distributions
  - Box plots to detect outliers

Skills Demonstrated:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Basic statistics
- Use of seaborn and matplotlib

----------------------------------------
TASK 4: General Health Query Chatbot
----------------------------------------

Objective:
To build a chatbot that responds to basic health-related queries using a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI GPT-3.5.

Steps Performed:
- Wrote a Python script to send user input to the LLM API
- Used prompt engineering to act like a safe and friendly medical assistant
- Included example queries like:
  - "What causes a sore throat?"
  - "Is paracetamol safe for children?"
- Applied safety by avoiding direct or harmful medical advice

Skills Demonstrated:
- Prompt engineering
- API usage (OpenAI GPT-3.5)
- Building a simple conversational agent with safe outputs

----------------------------------------
TASK 6: House Price Prediction
----------------------------------------

Objective:
To predict house prices using regression models on a dataset (Boston Housing).

Steps Performed:
- Loaded dataset with columns like rooms, income level, etc.
- Selected features: rm, lstat, ptratio
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Made predictions and visualized actual vs predicted values
- Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE

Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing
- Linear regression modeling
- Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
- Visualization of model performance
